            <b> Back Story!</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a brilliant strategist named Zeno. <br>
            he was renowned for his creative thinking and his ability to outsmart even the most cunning of opponents.
            <br>
            Zeno's skills were put to the test when a new turn-based game, 
            <br>
            "The Battle for the Kingdom," was introduced to the kingdom's citizens. And enjoy the wonderful quest
            <br>
            to explore the startegic games and beat all bosses with you
            <br>
            4 wonderful teams that can attack, shield, speed up, and heal.</div>

            <br>
            of their opponents. The game demanded a level of ingenuity, compelling players to explore

            Zeno was intrigued by the game and decided to give it a try.
            <br>
             he quickly rose through the ranks, defeating opponent after

            <br>
            Zeno realized that the game was more than just a simple battle;
